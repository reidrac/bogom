bogom - simple sendmail milter to interface bogofilter
Copyright (C) 2004-2007 Juan J. Martinez <jjm@usebox.net>


Required
--------

This milter requires libmiter API for sendmail 8.13.x or later.
Installing bogofilter is a good idea also.

Bogom has been developed and tested with the following:

	sendmail 8.13.0 and 8.14.1
	bogofilter 0.92.8 (with BerkeleyDB 4.2.52)


Build and Install
-----------------

This milter has been developed in OpenBSD, so you may need to tweak the
Makefile in order to compile it in other systems.

Check README.* files for specific notes.

On most Linux and BSD based systems, simply try:

$ make
$ su
# make install

Bogom has been packaged for FreeBSD (mail/milter-bogom) and non officially for
some Linux distributions.

IMPORTANT: since 1.8.1+ the bogom binary is installed into $(PREFIX)/libexec,
           so be sure to remove $(PREFIX)/sbin/bogom from any previous
           installation.


Unprivileged user
-----------------

When root starts bogom, the program drops its privileges to another user. It's
a good idea you create a new user to run the milter. By default bogofilter user
is expected.

# mkdir /var/spool/bogofilter

Configure bogofilter with:

bogofilter_dir=/var/spool/bogofilter

... and create your intial words database. 

After that, setup the environment with:

# chown -R bogofilter:bogofilter /var/spool/bogofilter
# chmod 700 /var/spool/bogofilter
# chmod 600 /var/spool/bogofilter/wordlist.db


Custom installation step by step
--------------------------------

bogom provides some defaults, but don't have to stick into them. 

Here follows a 'step by step' quickstart to configure bogom and bogofilter.

+ Install bogofilter
+ Install bogom
+ Create the '_bogom' user and group
+ Create the directories and apply permissions:

# mkdir -p /var/run/bogom && chown _bogom:_bogom /var/run/bogom
# mkdir -p /var/db/bogofilter && chown _bogom:_bogom /var/db/bogofilter

+ Copy the example bogofilter.cf file into /etc and edit it:

bogofilter_dir=/var/db/bogofilter

+ Setup bogofilter database. About 500 messages of spam/ham will be nice:

# su _bogom -c "bogofilter -s < spam.mbox"
# su _bogom -c "bogofilter -n < ham.mbox"

(use su with -m option if _bogom user doesn't have shell account)

+ Install the example conf file at /etc/bogom.conf and edit it. At least
you should set up:

user "_bogom"
pidfile "/var/run/bogom/bogom.pid"
connection "unix:/var/run/bogom/milter.sock"

+ Add to your sendmail mc file:

INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`bogom',\
`S=unix:/var/run/bogom/milter.sock, T=S:30s;R:1m')

(rebuild and install the cf file)

+ Add bogom to your rc or init.d scripts
+ Restart sendmail
+ Exec bogom or reboot the system
